          <h2>Hello.</h2>
          <p class="intro">I am an IT specialist with over four years of experience, mainly as direct technical support.
            Thanks to this, I can cooperate with various groups of employees.
            I have been interested in programming for a long time, currently I am focusing on independent
            learning and developing skills in Ruby on Rails and web development.</p>

            <h3>Web Development</h3>
            <p>A beginner who wants to gain knowledge in this field and learn from experienced people. 
              The beginnings of the Web Development Bootcamp course are very interesting and I look forward to the next chapters to supplement my knowledge of HTML, CSS, JS, SQL etc.</p>

            <h3>Ruby on Rails</h3>
            <p>A beginner who wants to gain knowledge in this field and learn from experienced people. Completing the course, as well as starting new ones in order to learn my own, 
              makes me understand Ruby on Rails better every day, but I also see many interesting things ahead of me.</p>

            <h3>Git</h3>
            <p>Every programmer's must-have friend. I used it in several courses with Ruby on Rails or Web Development, 
              thanks to which I feel confident working with git every day.</p>
